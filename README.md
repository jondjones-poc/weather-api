# Weather API - By Jon D Jones 💥

Call this API with a `postcode` query-string parameter to see what the current weather is like for your website.  Uses the following APIs to get the lat/long and then get the weather for that location:

- [https://api.darksky.net/](https://api.darksky.net/)
- [https://api.postcodes.io](https://api.postcodes.io)

Example: [https://weather-api-poc.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-weather?postcode=bh65nw](https://weather-api-poc.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-weather?postcode=bh11ph)

**API URL**: [https://weather-api-poc.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-weather](https://weather-api-poc.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/get-weather)
